# Logistic-regression-digits-classification
Logistic regression Machine learning algorithm using digits classifier

To build a logistic regression model that implements stochastic gradient ascent and apply it to the task of determining whether a number is 8 or 9

 Normalize your data.
 Transform your outputs into a set of binary features via one-hot encoding.
 Write get_optimal_parameters - train all ten models at once.
 Calculate the accuracy of your model on Train and Test data.
 Generate a confusion matrix on test and train Data.
 Predict the labels of the first ten datapoints from your test set alongside the images of those same datapoints.
